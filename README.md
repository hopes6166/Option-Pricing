# Option-Pricing
Option pricing based on input of stock price, risk free rate and dividend /n First, we have to estimate the following input: /n Stock price: Current Stock Price/n divident yield: assumed to be continuous
/n risk free rate: using the government bond/ note yield rate
/n volatility: this is the hardest thing to estimate due to its standard error. Historical information about rate of return can estimate it but may result in high variation.
/n Time to expiry: this is given at the beginning
